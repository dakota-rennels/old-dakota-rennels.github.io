## Oklahoma Data Science Initiative

**Project description:** Part of Oklahoma's State Data Platform (SDP) longevity support and services is to provide state agencies with advanced data analytics, machine learning capabilities, and program-driven classification and prediction models. As we develop and grow the foundational data discovery and data storage centralization through our hub-and-spoke model, we also will define the expectations for machine learning and AI model support. This Data Science (DS) Initiative involves creating a dedicated Data Science team, creating a Data Science Lifecycle and MLOps strategy, and procuring necessary Data Science tools.


### 1. Building a Data Science team
Although the entire project encompasses building out a Data Science team, the first step of the process is defining the personnel who can provide the necessary skillset of Data Science services and defining the expectation for progression of skills as the team grows. The Data Science team is built of Data Analysts and Data Scientists; however, the responsibilities and workload between the two roles are not exclusive. Common responsibilities in the early stages of the team center around Data Discovery as discovering existing datasets within state agencies is pivotal to the success of the SDP and Data Science team. Once datasets have been identified and schemas verified, the next step is working with the respective agency and the Data Engineering team to create a pipeling for data migration into the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Once data has been properly stored and tagged, the data science team will also assist with descriptive statistics, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and standard visualization and basic analytics. Data Scientists will be given more hands-on work with further Advanced Data Analytics (ADTA) and model creation. It is important as well to provide a path for advancement within the team and organization. A Data Analyst can progress towards a Sr. Data Analyst or Data Scientist postion and a Data Scientist can progress to Sr. Data Scientist or Sr. Technical Advisor. Both paths of progression can support future growth into managerial positions.

### 2. Creating a Data Science Lifecycle and MLOps Strategy
Where every step in the DS Initiative is important, creating and standardizing a DS Lifecycle and MLOps Strategy is vital to the longevity of the DS team and the models deployed for state agencies. This is argueably the most complex step of the project as there is no true national standard for a DS Lifecycle or MLOps Strategy. The most crucial piece of this step is defining the lifecycle and strategy early on to relay expectations of data quality and data governance from the point of data entry to its final destination. Where a DS Lifecycle and MLOps Strategy can often be considered the same, the separation here is that the DS Lifecycle starts from defining the business problem/quesiton to model deployment and is an extension of the existing State of Oklahoma's Data Lifecycle. MLOps is focused more directly on design, development, deployment, and operations of the model and helps maintain, sustain, and accelerate value <ins>after development</ins>.
