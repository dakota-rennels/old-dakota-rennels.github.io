## Data Science Portfolio Landing Page

### Introduction

This repository was created to build out my personal GitHub portfolio. The goal is to maintain current and past project progression for future personal growth. This README file is to serve as a directory for the existing portfolio. Please read through and do not hesitate to copy this repository as a template for your personal use. **Disclaimer** The buttons used in the actual portfolio were personally generated in Adobe Illustrator and currently I do not have a base template button added.

### Repository Directory

- **SAS Folder**: Contains .xml for SAS Enterprise Miner Classification and Predicition model diagrams. Also contains the PDF file for final report of the marketing campaign.
- **Layouts Folder**: Contains the default.html file used to create the default url and landing page of the portfolio. The code uses the repository name to establish the url.
